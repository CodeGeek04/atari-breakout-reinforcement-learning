# Atari BreakoutðŸ¥Ž Reinforcement Learning :robot:

This is a classic Atari Breakout game built using PyGame. The reinforcement learning task is carried out by QLearning Network in PyTorch. The Agent gets positive points if it breaks a brick or reflects ball, and negative reward if it misses the ball. You can tune hyperparameters like Rewards, Nodes in hidden Layers, Learning rate etc.

I have built another repo as well where two agents play Air-Hockey with each other..Do check that out too :grin::grin:
